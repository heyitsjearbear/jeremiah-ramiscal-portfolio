      <p>
        Aspiring software engineer, aspiring data scientist, aspiring web
        developer... blah blah blah. To be honest it's all cookie cutter.
        <b>I'll go further than that.</b>

      <h2>Growing Up</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up in an Asian-American household, I went through the motions,
        satisying the expectations that my parents set for me. I of course
        didn't want to dissapoint them, as they had sacrificed so much for my
        siblings and I to live a comfortable life. In high school, I immersed
        myself in my studies and extra-curriculars to give myself that edge when
        it came to college applications. That was fine and all, but in the blink
        of an eye, everything moved so fast. It was almost like I was trying to
        grow up too fast.
      </p>
      <h2>In the present</h2>
      <p>
        To preface what I am about to say, I do not condone succumbing to a
        "victim's mentality", though we all "feel" our emotions differently. As
        of writing this I am pursing my bachelors in Computer Science. So far in
        my college career, it seems like I have pushed important people in my
        life away, for the reason of wanting to be successful. To the half of
        you reading, you're probably thinking, "What's so wrong with that? You
        just want to be successful." It's true, I do want to be successful. So
        far though in my college career I've picked school and work over
        maintaining relationships with the friends and people I love.
      </p>
      <h2>For the Future</h2>
      <p>
        I hope to learn how to balance work and school with relationships. Human
        interaction in my opinion is something essential to living the fullest life.
        I am not perfect, I'll give myself that. But, there are things to work
        on. As of writing this, I must learn how to make experiences for myself,
        without having to depend on anyone to make them with/for me. I am a
        work-in progress. Life is so much more than working toward the
        inevitable 9-5 I desire.
      </p>
