      <p>
        Aspiring software engineer, aspiring data scientist, aspiring web
        developer... blah blah blah. To be honest it's all cookie cutter.
        <b>I'll go further than that.</b>

      <h2>Growing Up</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up in an Asian-American household, I went through the motions,
        satisying the expectations that my parents set for me. I of course
        didn't want to dissapoint them, as they had sacrificed so much for my
        siblings and I to live a comfortable life. In high school, I immersed
        myself in my studies and extra-curriculars to give myself that edge when
        it came to college applications. That was fine and all, but in the blink
        of an eye, everything moved so fast. It was almost like I was trying to
        grow up too fast.
      </p>
      <h2>In the present</h2>
      <p>
        I am pursuing my Computer Science degree, all the while balancing work
        and staying healthy by consitently going to the gym. I firmly believe that there is always
        something to be working on, though loving yourself and loving the journey
        in which you are partaking on is important as well.
      </p>
      <h2>For the Future</h2>
      <p>
        Life is so much more than the inevitable 9-5 I am trying to pursue. 
        I want to make experiences for myself, and romanticize my life the best I can, because
        I only live once!!! I want to take control of my life, and make it the best.
      </p>
