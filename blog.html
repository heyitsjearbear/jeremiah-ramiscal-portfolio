      <p>
        Aspiring software engineer, aspiring data scientist, aspiring web
        developer... blah blah blah. To be honest it's all cookie cutter.
        <b>I'll go further than that.</b>

      <h2>Growing Up</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up, in an Asian-American household, I went through motions,
        satisying the expectations that my parents set for me. I of course
        didn't want to dissapoint them, as they had sacrificed so much for my
        siblings and I to live a comfortable life. In high school, I immersed
        myself in my studies and extra-curriculars to give myself that edge when
        it came to college applications. That was fine and all, but in the blink
        of an eye, everything moved fast. It was almost like, I was trying to
        grow up fast.
      </p>
      <h2>In the present</h2>
      <p>
        It would be very unproductive of me to succumb to a "victim's
        mentality". As of writing this I am pursing my bachelors in Computer
        Science. So far in my college career, it seems like I have pushed
        important people in my life away, for the reason of wanting to be
        successful.
